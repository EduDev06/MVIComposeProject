# MVI Architecture Project with Compose in Android

## A fully functional MVI architecture project written in Kotlin highlighting how to handle differente sources like remote (Retrofit) database (Room)

This project is an example that was built along with a Youtube channel that shows how to create an Android Native App by applying a arquitecture pattern
such as MVI (Model-View-Intent) in Kotlin by fetching data from remote server. In this project you will show you the following:

- Create a flow to recover data from server by using Retrofit library
- Create a local database with Room to simulate the Single Source of Truth pattern
- Create an MVI architecture to handle user states from scratch by using Kotlin Flow
- Create the user interface with Jetpack Compose with a simple Content Animation whenever there is a fetching
